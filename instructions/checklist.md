db - completed.
connection.js - completed. - requires db 
orm.js - completed.  - requires connection
models - completed, -requires orm; should be working for first step.

I think ultimately backend is complete... now probably handlebars to complete clientController.js

clientController.js - completed - needs models working and handlebars for output


handlebars - completed
front endJava - completed


App Working!!!!
